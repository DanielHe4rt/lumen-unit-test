## :exclamation: The concept of everything

I found on my old drive some link for some Test for a random job who asks for a TDD heavy developer, so I decide to try to learn how to write and code TDD.

I chose to use Lumen because I work with the framework on a daily basis, so it makes a lot easier. Here is the most important about the code:

Used to make all tests run. I was about to use the Codeception, but PHPUnit is already native on Laravel/Lumen, so is a quite easy to run everything

Ok, now let's install and try it.
